        Farmers for Forests (F4F) is a hybrid social enterprise based in Pune,
        Maharashtra. Since 2019, we have been creating & supporting biodiverse
        farms & forests that significantly increase farmer income.<span>
          We harness the power of farmers, forests and technology in our mission
          to fight climate-change and poverty, at scale!</span

          <p class="description">
            Over 40% of India's workforce is engaged in agriculture. They are
            facing the brunt of climate-change. Erratic rainfall patterns,
            extreme weather events, degrading soils and diminishing water tables
            are all contributing to a significant decline in farmer yields and
            income.
            <br /><br />
            We help farms bring back lost fertility and biodiversity on their
            farms, significantly increasing their climate-resilience.
